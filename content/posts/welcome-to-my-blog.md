# Welcome to My Modern NiceGUI Blog!

Welcome to my cutting-edge blog! This is a demonstration of a modern, lightning-fast file-based blog built with **NiceGUI v2.22.1**, **Pico.css**, and **Python 3.13**.

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Generate a friendly greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the blog."

# Example usage
message = greet("World")
print(message)
```

## Markdown Support
